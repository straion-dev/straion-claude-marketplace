# Validating Rules

## Process

1. Receive description of what to validate (spec, task, or code)
2. Run `straion find-rules` — see [../shared/STRAION_CLI.md](../shared/STRAION_CLI.md)
3. Analyze compliance against each returned rule
4. Report structured findings

## Validation Levels

| Level | What                 | Check Against                             |
| ----- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Spec  | PRDs, ADRs, RFCs     | Architecture, security, design principles |
| Task  | Implementation tasks | Technical rules, API contracts, testing   |
| Code  | Actual changes       | Coding standards, security, performance   |

## Compliance Analysis

For each rule returned by the CLI:

1. Read and understand what it mandates/prohibits
2. Compare against the input
3. Identify gaps or violations
4. Assess severity (critical, important, minor)

## Output Format

```
## Rules Validation Report

### Summary
[X rules checked, Y compliant, Z issues]

### Compliant ✅
- **RULE-123**: [Rule summary] — ✅ [What was done correctly]

### Partial Compliance ⚠️
- **RULE-456**: [Rule summary] — ⚠️ [What's missing]
  - **Recommendation**: [Specific fix]

### Violations ❌
- **RULE-789**: [Rule summary] — ❌ [The violation]
  - **Risk**: [Impact]
  - **Fix**: [Concrete solution]
```

## Severity Guidelines

- **Critical**: Block until fixed
- **Important**: Address before proceeding
- **Minor**: Note for consideration

## Validation Loop

When violations are found:

1. Report specific violations with concrete fixes
2. User applies fixes
3. Re-validate to confirm compliance
4. Repeat until critical violations are resolved
